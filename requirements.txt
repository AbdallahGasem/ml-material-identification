# --- Core Data & Math ---
numpy>=1.21.0           # Essential for handling arrays (images are just big arrays)
pandas>=1.3.0           # Useful if you want to visualize data distribution (optional but recommended)

# --- Computer Vision ---
opencv-python>=4.5.0    # The main engine: Image loading, resizing, Augmentation, and Live Camera
scikit-image>=0.18.0    # specialized feature extractors (HOG, LBP) often easier to use than OpenCV

# --- Machine Learning ---
scikit-learn>=1.0.0     # The "Brains": Contains SVM, k-NN, Train-Test Split, and Metrics

# --- Model Saving ---
joblib>=1.1.0           # To save your trained model (best_model.joblib) and scaler

# --- Visualization (for your Report/Notebooks) ---
matplotlib>=3.4.0       # To plot accuracy charts and confusion matrices
seaborn>=0.11.0         # Makes your confusion matrix look professional
